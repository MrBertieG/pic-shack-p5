# Introduction

Welcome to my final Code Institute Project 5. This a full e-commerce application website with the purpose of selling pictures. 

It allows users to navigate freely, view products and make purchases without the need to create an account. The website incorporates full CRUD functionality. Another main feature of the website is the ability to have a superuser managing the content of the website and removing other user's content if need be. This also incoporates full CRUD functionlity.

Thye prodject has been developed using Django 3.2 framework.

# <a name="user-ex">1. User Experience</a>

## Design Approach 

For the first time I wanted to develop an application that is out of my confort zone, just so I can experience what's it like to work on a type of project theme where I might not necessarily have a personal connection or passion in it especially topics related to art. I wanted to be able to adapt and experience what would it be like to work with the customer's various requests.

I have visitited a varity of art selling websites and made some notes on the layout and design of the page. I have noticed they were fitting nicely with Boutique Ado's framework and decided to merge the two together.

The goeal is to develop a site that is clear and easy to navigate without clutter or unecessary features.

<br><br>

## User Expectation

<br>

- ### A first time visitor:
	- Understand imediatly the purpose of the website.
	- Easily navigate and see a sample of the products on the landing page.
	- Identify any deals.
	- Search for products in the search bar.
	- Easily click on a product for details.
	- Select a size if applicable.
	- Filter by category or price.
	- Add a product to the basket.
	- Change quantity or remove product all together.
	- Add more products to qualify for free delivery.
	- See and overview of the items in the basket.
	- Securley checkout.
	- Successfully make a purchase.
	- Receive email confirmation of the purchase information.
	- Signup to the newsletter for latest deals.
<br><br>

- ### A returning user:
	- Create an account.
	- View the order history if applicable.
	- Leave review on products.
	- Delete review on products.
	- Update personal details.
	- Reset password.
	- Signup to the newsletter.

<br>

- ### A frequent user:
	- Visit the website's 'New PicShack Prints' for any new products.

## Color Design
I have chosen to stick with a simple black and white design for accesssability purposes but also with the purpose of adding colours where it could make a difference to make a purchase.

The wireframe was created using Balsamiq. As you can see, as the project evolved, the design has also changed, however the wireframe was crucial in identifying which design approach the website will take.
